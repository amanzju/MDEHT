Description: Package implementing MDEHT method to perform a multivariate differential expression by Hotelling’s test 
  using isomiRs in small RNA-Seq data. Hotelling’s test is a generalization of Student's t- statistic and is widely
  used for testing the difference between two multivariate means.
